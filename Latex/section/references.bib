XP practices Test-Driven Development, pair programming, short interaction, a team code ownership and acceptance tests. Author writes about possibilities of information technologies when improving communicative skills of children with specific disorders, such as autistic spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, mental retardation, etc. The development of an application stemming from the communication system PECS (The Picture Exchange Communication System) and its Czech variant VOKS is the base of this paper to show specificity of the development and verification of software for the given group of handicapped users. The paper shows suitability of using agile methods of software development for a concrete application which is designed for users with specific disorders. It tries to show advantages and disadvantages of new methodologies, particularly Extreme Programming. This agile method prefers fast reaction to a change before the plan completion, which proved to be important in the case of the developed software. There were plenty of changes and new requirements during the development, and their solution was more important for the output quality than following the time schedule of the development.}

               We found that the more the new design performed to the system
               the less refactoring and error fix were performed. However, the
               refactoring and error fix efforts did not seem to be related. We
               also found that the error fix effort is related to number of
               days spent on each story, while new design is not. The
               relationship between the refactoring effort and number of days

               domains such as manufacturing, Kanban is increasingly used to
               achieve continuous development and delivery of value in the
               software industry. However, while research on Kanban in software
               is growing, these articles are largely descriptive, and there is
               limited rigorous research on its application and with little
               cohesive building of cumulative knowledge. As a result, it is
               extremely difficult to determine the true value of Kanban in
               software engineering. This study investigates the scientific
               evidence to date regarding Kanban by conducting a systematic
               mapping of Kanban literature in software engineering between
               2006 and 2016. The search strategy resulted in 382 studies, of
               which 23 were identified as primary papers relevant to this
               research. This study is unique as it compares the findings of
               these primary papers with insights from a review of 23 Kanban
               experience reports during the same period. This study makes four
               important contributions, (i) a state-of-the-art of Kanban
