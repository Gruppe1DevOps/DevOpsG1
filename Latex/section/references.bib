XP practices Test-Driven Development, pair programming, short interaction, a team code ownership and acceptance tests. Author writes about possibilities of information technologies when improving communicative skills of children with specific disorders, such as autistic spectrum disorders, Down syndrome, mental retardation, etc. The development of an application stemming from the communication system PECS (The Picture Exchange Communication System) and its Czech variant VOKS is the base of this paper to show specificity of the development and verification of software for the given group of handicapped users. The paper shows suitability of using agile methods of software development for a concrete application which is designed for users with specific disorders. It tries to show advantages and disadvantages of new methodologies, particularly Extreme Programming. This agile method prefers fast reaction to a change before the plan completion, which proved to be important in the case of the developed software. There were plenty of changes and new requirements during the development, and their solution was more important for the output quality than following the time schedule of the development.}

Agile Testing provides comprehensive coverage of the issues testers face when they move to Agile: from tools and metrics to roles and process. Illustrated with numerous stories and examples from many contributors, it gives a clear picture of what successful Agile testers are doing today.Bret Pettichord, Chief Technical Officer of WatirCraft and Lead Developer of WatirTesting is a key component of agile development. The widespread adoption of agile methods has brought the need for effective testing into the limelight, and agile projects have transformed the role of testers. Much of a testers function, however, remains largely misunderstood. What is the true role of a tester? Do agile teams actually need members with QA backgrounds? What does it really mean to be an agile tester? Two of the industrys most experienced agile testing practitioners and consultants, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory, have teamed up to bring you the definitive answers to these questions and many others. In Agile Testing, Crispin and Gregory define agile testing and illustrate the testers role with examples from real agile teams. They teach you how to use the agile testing quadrants to identify what testing is needed, who should do it, and what tools might help. The book chronicles an agile software development iteration from the viewpoint of a tester and explains the seven key success factors of agile testing.Readers will come away from this book understandingHow to get testers engaged in agile developmentWhere testers and QA managers fit on an agile teamWhat to look for when hiring an agile testerHow to transition from a traditional cycle to agile developmentHow to complete testing activities in short iterationsHow to use tests to successfully guide developmentHow to overcome barriers to test automationThis book is a must for agile testers, agile teams, their managers, and their customers.}

               as central parts of non-traditional software products have
               changed how software products are developed. It started with the
               introduction of the agile manifesto and has resulted in a change
               of how software process improvements (SPI) are conducted.
               Although there are agile SPI methods and several agile practices
               for evaluating and improving current processes and
               ways-of-working, no method or practices for evaluating the
               backlog exists. To address this gap, the Backlog Assessment
               Method (BAM) was developed and applied in collaboration with
               Telenor Sweden. BAM enables agile organizations to assess
               backlogs, and assure that the backlog items are good-enough for
               their needs and well aligned with the decision process. The
               results from the validation show that BAM is feasible and
               relevant in an industrial environment, and it indicates that BAM
